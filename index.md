##  Computer Vision Projects()
[Graduation](https://graduation.udacity.com/nd891)
- ### [Facial expression recognition and Augmented Reality (AR)](https://github.com/aksht94/UdacityOpenSource/tree/master/EmoAR)
EmoAR is a mobile AR application (mobile device with ARCore support is required) that aims to recognize human facial expression in real time and to overlay virtual content according to the recognized facial expression.
- ### [Facial Keypoint Detection ](https://github.com/calincan2000/CVND-Facial-Keypoint-Detection)
Apply your knowledge of image processing and deep learning to create a CNN for facial keypoint (eyes,
mouth, nose, etc.) detection.
- ### [Image Captioning ](https://github.com/calincan2000/CVND-Image-Captioning-PyTorch-)
Train a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image. Your main task will be to implement an
effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder.
- ### [Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM)](https://github.com/calincan2000/CVND-Landmark-Detection-Tracking-SLAM-)
Implement SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding
environment, using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra.
