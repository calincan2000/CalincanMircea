## Deep Learning Projects -[See credential](https://confirm.udacity.com/PVQRUS73)

- ### [Image-classifier from scratch that will identify different species of flowers](https://github.com/calincan2000/Image-classifier)
Project image classifier from scratch that will identify different species of flowers
- ### [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns ](https://github.com/calincan2000/project-bikesharing)
Learn neural network basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep
learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.
In this project, you'll build and train your own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of
bikeshare users on a given day. Good luck!
- ### [Dog Breed Classifier ](https://github.com/calincan2000/Dog-Breed-Classifier)
Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on
patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising.
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an
image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.
- ### [Generate-TV-Scripts ](https://github.com/calincan2000/Generate-TV-Scripts)
Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment
analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.
- ### [Generate Faces ](https://github.com/calincan2000/GenerateFaces)
Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate
realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.
Define two adversarial networks, a generator and discriminator, and train them until you can generate
realistic faces
- ### [Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model](https://github.com/calincan2000/Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model)
Train and deploy your own sentiment analysis model using Amazon's SageMaker. Deployment gives you the
ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for
accessing it from a website.
- ### [Somalia UNHCR Patterns](https://github.com/unhcr/Jetson/tree/master/Finding-the-Nexus/FindTheNexusDeepLearning)
A neural network that predicts and compares the weekly Vegetation Health Index with the number of forced displacements of Somalia by using historical data as described [here](https://medium.com/omdena/using-ai-to-predict-droughts-floods-and-conflict-displacements-in-somalia-40cba6200f3c)


##  Computer Vision Projects()-[See credential](https://confirm.udacity.com/M949C59C)

- ### [Facial expression recognition and Augmented Reality (AR)](https://github.com/aksht94/UdacityOpenSource/tree/master/EmoAR)
EmoAR is a mobile AR application (mobile device with ARCore support is required) that aims to recognize human facial expression in real time and to overlay virtual content according to the recognized facial expression.
- ### [Facial Keypoint Detection ](https://github.com/calincan2000/CVND-Facial-Keypoint-Detection)
Apply your knowledge of image processing and deep learning to create a CNN for facial keypoint (eyes,
mouth, nose, etc.) detection.
- ### [Image Captioning ](https://github.com/calincan2000/CVND-Image-Captioning-PyTorch-)
Train a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image. Your main task will be to implement an
effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder.
- ### [Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM)](https://github.com/calincan2000/CVND-Landmark-Detection-Tracking-SLAM-)
Implement SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding
environment, using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra.


## Deep Reinforcement Learning Projects -[See credential]( https://confirm.udacity.com/NMV23PC2)
- ### [Navigation DeepReinforcemnt Learning ](https://github.com/calincan2000/Navigation_DeepReinforcemntLearning)
Train an agent to navigate a large world and collect yellow bananas, while avoiding blue bananas.
- ### [Continuous Control ](https://github.com/calincan2000/Continuous_Control)
Train a double-jointed arm to reach target locations.
- ### [Tenis Collaboration And Competition](https://github.com/calincan2000/TenisCollaborationAndCompetition)
Train a pair of agents to play tennis.
